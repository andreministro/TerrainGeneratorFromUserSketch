# TerrainGeneratorFromUserSketch
Project for a Master Thesis: Terrain Generator based on a User sketch

Open the TerrainScene, click the ImageReader GameObject in the Hierarchy and assign a .png image sketch, choose a seed value and click play.

You'll be presented with an orthographic view of the terrain, press "K" to change to a First Person free camera, press "L" to change to a First Person player perspective camera, press "O" to go back to the orthogonal camera.
